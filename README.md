# Quran-Images-AyahByAyah
For each image the background image is given. <br />
We need to align text on the image. Text includes Arabic text and Urdu translation. <br />
The font of the text should be set automatically, if it is a small Ayah, then font would be bigger and if it is a big ayah then the font would be small so that All the text and its translation fit on one image. <br />
The text can be be taken from https://tanzil.net/ (Both arabic and translation). For Arabic text we need to take text with Diacritic (Zeir zabar peish etc) <br />
It should be generic so that later on we can replace the background image or Quranic text source or translations and generate images for complete Quran. <br />
